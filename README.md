## _Installation_
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## _Project Motivation_
For this project, I was interestested in using Titanic Data from Kaggle to better understand:

1. How to find out how many people were on the Titanic
2. How many male and female passengers are there based on their age?
3. Who survived the sinking of the Titanic?
4. What is the fare paid by passengers to board the Titanic?
  
## _File Descriptions_

There is a notebook available here to showcase the work related to the above question. Each of these notebooks is exploratory in looking for data related to the questions presented by the title of the notebook.

## _Results_
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## _Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements_
Must give credit to Titanic for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
